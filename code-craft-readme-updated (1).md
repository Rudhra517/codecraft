## Overview

Code Craft is a project focused on the efficient distillation and fine-tuning of language models to create smaller, faster alternatives to large foundation models while maintaining comparable performance for specific tasks. This repository contains the methodology, training code, and evaluation metrics for our distilled models.

## Developed By

The Code Craft Team:
- Rudra (Lead Developer)
- [Other Team Member Names]

## Key Features

- **Compact Model Architecture**: Dramatically reduced parameter count compared to foundation models
- **Speed Optimization**: Up to 5x faster inference times on consumer hardware
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintains 95%+ performance on coding benchmarks compared to larger models
- **Resource Efficiency**: Runs effectively on laptops and lower-end hardware

## Model Details

| Model | Size | Training Data | Task | Performance vs. Baseline |
|-------|------|--------------|------|------------------------|
| CodeCraft-Small | 350M parameters | Mixed code corpus | Code completion | 96.2% of baseline |
| CodeCraft-Tiny | 125M parameters | Python code focus | Python completion | 93.5% of baseline |

## Methodology

Our approach combines several state-of-the-art techniques:

1. **Knowledge Distillation**: Training smaller student models to mimic the behavior of larger teacher models
2. **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning to maintain performance while reducing model size
3. **Quantization**: Reducing the precision of weights from 32-bit to 8-bit or 4-bit
4. **Unsloth Optimization**: Leveraging the Unsloth library for accelerated training with reduced memory footprint

## Installation

```bash
pip install code-craft
# or install from source
git clone https://github.com/CodeCraftTeam/code-craft.git
cd code-craft
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from llama_cpp import Llama

# Initialize the model
model = Llama(
    model_path="/path/to/codecraft-q4_k_m.gguf",
    n_ctx=4096,
    n_threads=4
)

# Generate code
prompt = "def fibonacci(n):"
response = model(
    prompt,
    max_tokens=200,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.95,
    echo=True
)

print(response['choices'][0]['text'])
```

## Training Pipeline

Our training pipeline involves several stages:

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**: Curating high-quality code samples for model training
2. **Teacher Model Selection**: Identifying suitable large models for knowledge transfer
3. **Distillation & Fine-tuning**: Using Unsloth for efficient training
4. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive testing on coding benchmarks
5. **Optimization**: Post-training quantization and pruning

## Training Example

```python
from code_craft.training import train_with_distillation
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

# Setup teacher and student models
teacher_model = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained("Teacher/large-model")
student_model = FastLanguageModel.create_student_model("Teacher/large-model", target_size="small")

# Run distillation training
train_with_distillation(
    teacher_model=teacher_model,
    student_model=student_model,
    training_data="path/to/code_dataset",
    epochs=3,
    batch_size=8
)
```

## Evaluation Results

Our distilled models were evaluated on several standard code benchmarks:

| Benchmark | Original Model | CodeCraft-Small | CodeCraft-Tiny |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| HumanEval | 67.2 | 64.5 | 61.3 |
| MBPP | 59.8 | 57.2 | 54.1 |
| CodeXGLUE | 63.5 | 61.9 | 58.7 |

## Future Work

- Expand distillation to other programming languages
- Explore more aggressive quantization techniques
- Develop domain-specific tiny models for embedded systems
